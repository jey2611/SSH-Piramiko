# SSH-Piramiko
Login to Network Devices and Execute Commands

This Code takes a List of devices and a list of CLI Commands and iterate through the loop.  


Here is my code: 



import paramiko


def startssh(host, user, passwd, commands):
    # type: (object, object, object, object) -> object

    # Create Paramiko Session
    ssh_client = paramiko.SSHClient()

    # Must set the Host key policy as we haven't got the SSH key stored in Known Hosts
    ssh_client.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())

    # Connect to Device
    ssh_client.connect(hostname=host,
                       username=user,
                       password=passwd)

    # if any error the Paramiko will throw an exception, so not checking for errors

    # append output to a file
    output = open('terminaloutput.txt', 'a')
    # Marking the Output more readable by using these lines as delimiter for each device
    output.write('\n ###################################')
    output.write('\n Connected to ')
    output.write(host)
    output.write('\n ###################################')

    # sending the CLI commands to the device
    stdin, stdout, stderr = ssh_client.exec_command(commands)
    outputstring = stdout.read()
    output.write(outputstring)
    output.write('\n')

    # terminate the SSH session
    ssh_client.close()
    return


netdevices = ['192.168.0.1','192.168.0.1']
username = 'cisco'
password = 'cisco'
command = ['show ip route','show ip int brie']


    # Iterate through the list of devices with the list of commands to execute


for device in netdevices:
    for cmd in command:
        startssh(device, 'jey.siva', 'January2011', cmd)
